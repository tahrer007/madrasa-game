## Build-a-Sentence Game: A Language Learning Tool for Madrasa
I volunteered to develop a "Build-a-Sentence" game for Madrasa, an educational organization focused on helping Israelis learn Arabic through technology. The game allows users to construct sentences from provided options and was built using vanilla JavaScript, with a recent refactoring to use React for improved performance.
